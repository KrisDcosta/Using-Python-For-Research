# Using Python for Research - Course Work

This repository contains my work from the **[Using Python for Research](https://www.edx.org/course/using-python-for-research)** course on EdX. This course, offered by Harvard University, focuses on applying Python to scientific research and data analysis. The materials include code, exercises, and projects completed throughout the course.

## Course Overview
The course covers essential Python skills and libraries widely used in research. Topics include:
- **Data Analysis**: Working with datasets and performing data manipulation.
- **Data Visualization**: Using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for scientific visualization.
- **Statistics and Machine Learning**: Applying statistical methods and machine learning techniques to data.
- **Scientific Libraries**: Using `NumPy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, and more to solve research-oriented problems.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:
- **`Week_X_Topic/`**: Jupyter notebooks covering different sections and exercises from the course week wise.

## Acknowledgments
This work is based on the **"Using Python for Research"** course by Harvard University on EdX.
